# FileGenerator
Active templating language, made to generate files specifically for finance

This is a POC (proof of concept) on creating "active" templating. In the end, this is a simple programming which is designed at generating files for Financial Messaging.
"Active" templating offers more flexibility when defining test messages, which eases complex corner-cases testing while being automated.

This project is NOT actively maintained, and use it at your own risks.
